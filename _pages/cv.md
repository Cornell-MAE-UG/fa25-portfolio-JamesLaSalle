#### Objective
I'm a student at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I am currently one of the full team leads of the Combat Robotics @ Cornell project team, and I spend most of my time working on 12 pound combat robots with high kinetic energy weapons to compete at events hosted by the National Havoc Robot League (NHRL).

---

#### Projects
- **Robotic Exercise Machine Project**:  
  *During the summer of 2024, I helped two Cornell alumni design, iterate, and prototype a robotic exercise machine for their startup company.*  
  - Modeled and partially designed an entire prototype system of lifts, weights, mixture dispensers, and a user input 
device in Fusion 360. Ergonomics, aesthetics, and strict height and manufacturing constraints were kept in mind.  
  - Used structural analysis simulations in Fusion360 to ensure load bearing structures had a desired factor of safety. 

- **Kinetic Sub-team Co-Lead, Combat Robotics @ Cornell**:  
  *During my junior year (2024-2025), I was on of the leads of the Kinetic Sub-team on my project team. The Kinetic Sub-team designs a 12 pound combat robot with a high kinetic energy weapon from scratch each year, and then manufactures and assembles it in order to compete at an NHRL competition in the spring.*  
  - Developed a timeline that outlines goals and deadlines on a meeting-to-meeting basis for the entire academic year.
  - Delegated tasks and responsibilities to teammates based on interest and skill level as well as provided technical 
guidance in things like CADing and speccing calculations to new members that were still learning.
  - Worked closely with other leads of the team to maintain steady progress in the team’s yearly design cycles, safety 
for the members, and a fun, supportive and inclusive environment for members of all experience levels.

#### Work Experience
- **Fluid Mechanisms - Intern**  
  [June 2025, Year] - [August, 2025]  
  - Inspected various helicopter parts and assemblies designed by companies like Boeing and Sikorsky to verify rivet 
sizes, deburring, and tolerances on the order of thousandths. I also calibrated precision tools such as micrometers. 
  - Worked with parts drawings, relevant paperwork, and created an extensive database of the tools used in the 
Quality Department to keep the department organized and save massive amounts of time on day-to-day work.
